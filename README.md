The VR-Based Language Translation App is an immersive multilingual communication tool that integrates voice recognition, computer vision, and expressive speech synthesis 
to enable seamless real-time translations. Designed for travelers, educators, and business professionals, this app enhances traditional translation methods by incorporating 
gesture recognition, sign language support, and interactive learning features within a VR/AR environment. Key features include real-time voice translation for instant spoken 
word interpretation, computer vision text translation to scan and translate written text from images, and sign language recognition using pose detection for inclusivity. The 
Learn Mode tracks spoken words, provides feedback, and awards achievements to encourage language practice, while an Offline Mode ensures accessibility even without an internet
connection. Users can also customize the UI, adjusting fonts, voices, and themes to suit their preferences. The interface consists of a main screen with language selection 
dropdowns and three primary functions: Start Listening for speech translation, Learn Mode for tracking progress, and Scanner Mode for real-world text recognition. The settings
menu (bottom left) allows Google Sign-In, model selection, voice preferences, offline mode activation, and feedback submission. In Scanner Mode, detected text is displayed at 
the top center, with language preferences at the bottom center, a Narrator Mode toggle at the bottom right, and navigation options at the bottom left. The app is built using 
Node.js for frontend web-based VR development, Python for backend processing, OpenCV for computer vision features, and TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI-driven translations. 
Installation is simple: clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install and pip install -r requirements.txt, then run npm start for the frontend and python 
app.py for the backend. Future enhancements include AR integration for real-time object translation, gesture-based controls for hands-free navigation, multi-user VR 
environments for collaborative translation, and achievements & rewards in Learn Mode. Contributors can fork the repository, create a feature branch, commit changes, 
push updates, and submit a pull request. The project is licensed under the MIT License, and users can reach out via issues or email for inquiries.
